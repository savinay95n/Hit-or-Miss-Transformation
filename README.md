# Hit-or-Miss-Transformation

The objective of this project is to detect patterns of a specific shape and size in noisy images by using morphological transformations. We design and implement one appropriate Hit-or-Miss transformation for detecting and extracting smallest and largest disks in the given image with added noise. This project will help us understand the practical implementations of set functions such as intersection and union and operations such as erosion. It will also help in understanding the effect of noise on the performance of morphological transformations.
